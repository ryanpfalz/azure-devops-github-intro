## 1. Create an Azure DevOps organization.
## 2. Set up your project and team structure.

-   A DevOps team should include members with a variety of skills, including system administrators, software developers, and operations engineers. The team should also include people with a background in automation, testing, and security. It is important to have both technical and non-technical members to ensure that the team is well-rounded and has a comprehensive understanding of the project.

## 3. Document a team charter

-   Identify the purpose and scope of the team: Before writing the team charter, it's important to clearly define the purpose and scope of the team. This includes outlining the team's goals, objectives, and expectations.
-   Outline team roles and responsibilities: Once the purpose and scope of the team is identified, the team charter should outline the roles and responsibilities for each team member. This includes who is responsible for what tasks, who will lead the team, and who will be responsible for decision-making.
-   Establish team rules: Establishing team rules is essential to ensure everyone is on the same page and understands the expectations of the team. This includes rules for communication, collaboration, and decision-making.
-   Establish team metrics and performance goals: Establishing team metrics and performance goals is important to ensure that the team is meeting its goals. This includes establishing KPIs, metrics, and performance goals.
-   Finalize and approve the team charter: ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands the expectations of the team.

## 4. Establish your planning and collaboration practices.

-   Sprint Planning
-   Daily Standup
-   Backlog Refinement
-   Sprint Review/Demo
-   Sprint Retrospective

## 5. Set up your source control

-   Establish the Goals of Your Branching Strategy: Decide what you want to accomplish with your branching strategy. Consider how your team will use source control and how to support their workflow.
-   Choose a Branching Model: Select a branching model that best suits your goals. Common models include Gitflow, Feature Branching, and Trunk-Based Development.
-   Define Your Branches: Define the types of branches you need, such as feature branches, release branches, hotfix branches, and master branches.
-   Define Naming Conventions: Establish a naming convention for branches that everyone on the team can easily understand.
-   Set Up Automation: Automate processes like merging, testing, and deployment to reduce manual effort and improve consistency.
-   Document Your Strategy: Document your strategy and ensure that all members of the team are aware of it.

## 6. Set up your continuous integration/delivery pipelines.

-   Configure the pipeline to run on a regular schedule or when changes are committed to the source code.

    -   Log into your Azure DevOps organization and select the project you want to configure.
    -   Select Pipelines from the left navigation.
    -   Click the "New pipeline" button at the top of the page.
    -   Select the source code repository where your project is stored.
    -   Select the type of build you want to create.
    -   Configure the build agent, tasks, and options.
    -   Save your build configuration.
    -   Test your build by queuing a build.
    -   Monitor your build results and make any necessary changes.
    -   Save your final build configuration.

-   Configure Tests: Configure tests to run in the build pipeline. These tests could be unit tests, integration tests, or other types of tests.

## 7. Create your deployment pipelines for different environments.

-   Create a Release Pipeline: Create a release pipeline in Azure DevOps to deploy the build artifacts to the desired environment.

    -   Log in to your Azure DevOps account and navigate to the Releases page.
    -   Create a new release pipeline.
    -   Configure the trigger so that the release is triggered every time a new build is available.
    -   Add the tasks needed to deploy your code.
    -   Set up the environment variables needed for the release.
    -   Test the release pipeline to make sure that everything is working properly.
    -   Save the release pipeline and deploy it to the target environment.

-   Configure Deployment: Configure the deployment steps in the release pipeline to deploy the build artifacts to the environment.

## 8. Configure your quality and approval gates.

-   Quality standards/expectations and enforcement tied to work items via Test Plans

## 9. Establish your release management and operations.

-   Define a repeatable, process that ensures that all releases are planned and executed in an organized and efficient manner.
-   define the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders involved in the release
-   Quality Assurance practices: sign off both before and after release
-   Identify and Document Release Procedures (e.g., notification of release, change log, ensure it is accessible to all stakeholders, ensure there is a feedback process from stakeholders, ensure any training is completed, ensure stakeholder satisfaction)
-   Communication plan: ensure that all stakeholders are kept up to date on the progress of the release and that any issues are identified and addressed in a timely manner

## 10. Monitor and measure your solutions.

-   Create a dashboard to report build and release steps
-   Monitor the pipeline and create reports to track the pipeline performance.
